Great — you're asking how JavaScript runs behind the scenes, step by step. Let's break it down in simple terms, focusing on the JavaScript engine and its process.

🧠 Big Picture: What Runs JavaScript?
JavaScript is executed by a JavaScript engine — like V8 (used in Chrome and Node.js), SpiderMonkey (Firefox), or JavaScriptCore (Safari).

🔄 JavaScript Execution Steps (Behind the Scenes)
1. Parsing
JavaScript code (text) is parsed by the engine.

It's turned into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) — a structured representation of the code.

js
Copy
Edit
const a = 5;
➡ becomes structured like:

scss
Copy
Edit
VariableDeclaration
  └─ Identifier (a)
  └─ Literal (5)
2. Compilation
Modern engines like V8 use Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.

They convert the AST into bytecode or machine code, not just interpreting line by line.

This improves performance.

3. Execution
The engine creates an Execution Context for every function or global code:

Inside an Execution Context:
Memory Creation Phase (Creation Stage):

Allocates memory for:

Variables → initialized with undefined

Functions → loaded fully

A scope is created (lexical environment).

Code Execution Phase:

Variables are assigned actual values.

Functions are executed line by line.

The Call Stack starts growing with function calls.

4. Call Stack
JavaScript is single-threaded → only one task runs at a time.

Each function call is pushed onto the Call Stack.

When the function finishes, it’s popped off.

scss
Copy
Edit
Main()
 └─ greet()
     └─ sayHi()
5. Memory (Stack vs Heap)
Primitives → Stored in the stack.

Objects/Arrays/Functions → Stored in the heap, stack stores references.

6. Web APIs & Event Loop (Browser Only)
For things like:

setTimeout()

DOM events

Fetch/network calls

These go to Web APIs (handled by the browser), not the main thread.

7. Callback Queue + Event Loop
When async work (like a timer) is done, its callback goes to a callback queue.

The Event Loop constantly checks:

“Is the Call Stack empty?”

If yes → move the next callback from the queue to the stack.

🧪 Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout");
}, 0);

console.log("End");
Output:

sql
Copy
Edit
Start
End
Timeout
Even with 0 delay, the setTimeout goes to the Web API, then waits its turn via the event loop.

🧩 Summary of the Flow:
Parse → AST

Compile → Bytecode

Execute:

Memory setup

Call stack + heap

Async tasks → Web APIs

Event loop moves callbacks to the call stack
